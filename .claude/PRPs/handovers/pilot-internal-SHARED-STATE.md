# pilot-internal — SHARED STATE (cross-session coordination)

> **Purpose:** this file coordinates TWO concurrent advisor sessions during pilot-internal:
> - **This session (infra/bridge):** brings up Matrix homeserver + Brehon bridge + Lemmy↔bridge wiring.
> - **Testing session:** exercises governance flows via the seeded accounts/community.
>
> **Read this at the top of every turn if you are EITHER session.** Most-recent timestamped
> entry in §"Live status" is authoritative. Both sessions append; neither rewrites the other's
> entries. If you need the other session to do something, write it under §"Cross-session asks".

## §1. What's running (homeserver `100.81.145.58` / LAN `192.168.1.157`)

| Service | Container | Port (host) | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Lemmy API | `docker-lemmy-1` | `8536` | ✅ UP | Rebuilt 2026-06-13 from `governance-v0 @ 8ac81ea90` (full M2) |
| Lemmy UI | `docker-lemmy-ui-1` | `1236` (via proxy) | ✅ UP | `http://100.81.145.58:1236` / `http://192.168.1.157:1236` |
| Postgres (Lemmy) | `docker-postgres-1` | `5433` | ✅ UP | user/pw/db = lemmy/password/lemmy |
| pict-rs | `docker-pictrs-1` | (internal) | ✅ UP | media uploads work |
| nginx proxy | `docker-proxy-1` | `1236`,`8536` | ✅ UP | |
| **Matrix (Tuwunel)** | `brehon-tuwunel` | `8448`→8008 | ✅ UP | v1.7.1, `server_name=localhost`, federation OFF |
| **Brehon bridge** | `brehon-bridge` | TBD (8081?) | ⏳ NOT YET | being wired this session |

**Tuwunel compose:** `/srv/brehon-fork/services/bridge/docker-compose.pilot.yml` + `tuwunel-pilot.toml` (homeserver-only, not committed).

## §2. Test accounts + community (per `reference_pilot_test_accounts.md`)

- Admin: `lemmy` / `lemmylemmy`
- `testmod` (person 4) — approved, login verified
- `testuser` (person 5) — approved, login verified
- Community: `test_governance` (id=2) — public, open posting
- API: `http://100.81.145.58:8536/api/v4/...`

## §3. What's safe to test NOW (DB-layer, no bridge needed)

✅ The testing session can proceed with these immediately — they do NOT depend on the bridge:
- User registration / login / posting / commenting in `test_governance`
- Flagging/reporting posts
- Admin case creation (ModerationCase)
- Juror assignment (admin_assign_jury)
- Jury voting + quorum → sanction row + governance_log entries written to DB

⚠️ These do NOT yet propagate to Matrix (bridge not wired): jury-room provisioning, sanction power-level enforcement. The DB-side governance logic fires regardless; only the Matrix side is pending.

## §4. Live status (most-recent entry authoritative — APPEND, don't rewrite)

### 2026-06-13T08:2x (infra session) — Tuwunel up; bridge wiring STARTING
- Tuwunel v1.7.1 live on `:8448`, registered `@pilottest:localhost` end-to-end. ✅
- Lemmy rebuilt from `8ac81ea90` (full M2 code). ✅
- Bridge wiring task list created (5 tasks). Starting Task 1 (compile-check + Dockerfile).
- **T6 still FAIL:** `sanction_subscriber=0`, no `BRIDGE_*` env on Lemmy, bridge not running. Closing via Tasks 3+4.

## §5. Cross-session asks

_(none yet — testing session: nothing blocking you; proceed with §3 DB-layer testing)_

## §6. Hazards / do-not-touch

- **Infra session owns:** `/srv/brehon-fork/services/bridge/`, the Tuwunel container, the lemmy container ENV (will restart lemmy when wiring BRIDGE_SANCTION_CALLBACK_URL — this drops connections for ~10s; testing session expect a brief blip).
- **Do NOT** restart `docker-lemmy-1` from the testing session without coordinating here (it re-seeds sanction_subscriber at startup).
- Port `8080` on homeserver is taken by `web-archive-frontend` — bridge will use a different host port.
- extism stays at 1.21.0 (do NOT bump to 1.30.0).
